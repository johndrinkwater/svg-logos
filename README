A hand‐made collection of reusable, very compact, and carefully adjusted SVG
files of popular Web fronts.

Disclaimer: these are obviously unofficial, hand‐crafted to be as compact as
possible for inclusion in stylesheets or spritesheets with minimal overhead.
They should not be used above 256×256px as minor differences to the originals
may show. Again, they are not intended to be exact replicas, rather near enough
to look great and still be small in bytes.

Created in a manner to be themeable and to theme, your websites.

You’re welcome to use these files on your site, as long as you point back here
so others can enjoy updates to the set.

See http://johndrinkwater.github.io/svg-logos/ / gh-pages branch for a demo.
