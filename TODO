Just some TODOs to finish these up.

* Also discover how best to tackle that YouTube infill w/ CSS. Change even-odd ?
* Decide on HTML5 attributes for the <svg> so we can reuse them once included once

Next logos:
* Lastfm?
* LinkedIn/Facebook/Tumblr/Pinterest are probably on my LOL no list for now
