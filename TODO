Just some TODOs to finish these up.

* Also discover how best to tackle that YouTube infill w/ CSS. Change even-odd ?
* Decide on HTML5 attributes for the <svg> so we can reuse them once included once

Next logos:
* Digg (man+spade logo)
* Email?
* Keybase (though this is bloody hard!)
* Evernote?
* SpeakerDeck/Slideshare/Prezi?
* Feedly?
* Lastfm?
* Paypal?
* Slashdot
* StumbleUpon?
* LinkedIn/Facebook/Tumblr/Myspace/Pinterest are probably on my LOL no list for now
* Flickr variant (left circle filled, right circle just stroked)
