Just some TODOs to finish these up.

* Resize so they all fit a general pattern - I know one is grossly wrong atm
* Configure attributes and style so they are ready for CSS theming/animation
* Also discover how best to tackle that YouTube infill w/ CSS. Change even-odd ?
* Decide on HTML5 attributes for the <svg> so we can reuse them once included once

Next logos:
* Lastfm?
* LinkedIn/Facebook/Tumblr/Pinterest are probably on my LOL no list for now
